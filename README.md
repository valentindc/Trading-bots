# Trading-bots
Bots to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies

The ones written to trade stocks were built following the algorithmic trading course developed by Nick McCullum https://github.com/nickmccullum/algorithmic-trading-python .

The binance volatility trading bot is similar to the one done in https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-volatility-trading-bot

This last one still has some issues I've got to get around but not that far off the functional bot I expect
